## opencascade-sys API Patterns

The Rust bindings mirror OCCT C++ closely but with automatic name transformations:

### Module and Type Naming
- `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeEdge` → `b_rep_builder_api::MakeEdge`
- `BRep_Tool` → `b_rep::Tool`
- `gp_Pnt` → `gp::Pnt`
- `TopExp_Explorer` → `top_exp::Explorer`
- `GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` → `geom_api::ProjectPointOnSurf`
- `STEPControl_Reader` → `step_control::Reader`
- `RWStl` → `rw_stl` (free functions)

### Constructors
Named `::new_<compressed_param_types>()`. For example:
```rust
gp::Pnt::new_real3(x, y, z)           // gp_Pnt(double, double, double)
gp::Dir::new_real3(dx, dy, dz)
top_exp::Explorer::new_shape_shapeenum2(shape, from_type, avoid_type)
geom_api::ProjectPointOnSurf::new_pnt_handlegeomsurface_extalgo(pt, surf, algo)
```

### Ownership
- All objects are returned as `OwnedPtr<T>` which auto-derefs via `Deref`/`DerefMut`
- `OwnedPtr<T>` is essentially `Box<T>` for OCCT heap objects

### Handles (OCCT `Handle<T>`)
- `Type::to_handle(owned_ptr)` consumes `OwnedPtr<T>` → `OwnedPtr<HandleT>`
- `.get()` dereferences a handle to access the underlying object
- Upcasting: `.to_handle_surface()`, `.to_handle_curve()`, etc.
- Downcasting: `.downcast_to_plane()` returns `Option<OwnedPtr<HandleDerived>>`

### Enums
Typed Rust enums, not raw integers:
```rust
top_abs::ShapeEnum::Face
extrema::ExtAlgo::Grad
```

### Shape Downcasting
`topo_ds::face_shape` is a safe function, but it panics if the shape is not a Face. Always guard with `shape_type()`:
```rust
if shape_ref.shape_type() == top_abs::ShapeEnum::Face {
    let face = topo_ds::face_shape(shape_ref);  // &topo_ds::Shape → &topo_ds::Face
    ...
}
```

### Static Methods → Free Functions
OCCT utility classes (e.g., `BRep_Tool`) become module-level free functions or associated functions on the type.

## Common API Recipes

### Read an STL file → vertex positions
```rust
use opencascade_sys::{rw_stl, message};
let progress = message::ProgressRange::new();
let tri_handle = rw_stl::read_file_charptr_progressrange_2(path, &progress);
let tri = tri_handle.get();  // &Poly_Triangulation
for i in 1..=tri.nb_nodes() {
    let pt = tri.node(i);  // OwnedPtr<gp::Pnt>
    let (x, y, z) = (pt.x(), pt.y(), pt.z());
}
```

### Read a STEP file → TopoDS_Shape
```rust
use opencascade_sys::{step_control, message};
let mut reader = step_control::Reader::new();
reader.read_file_charptr(path);
reader.transfer_roots(&message::ProgressRange::new());
let shape = reader.one_shape();  // OwnedPtr<topo_ds::Shape>
```

### Iterate faces of a shape
```rust
use opencascade_sys::{top_exp, top_abs, topo_ds};
let mut explorer = top_exp::Explorer::new_shape_shapeenum2(
    &shape, top_abs::ShapeEnum::Face, top_abs::ShapeEnum::Shape,
);
while explorer.more() {
    let face = topo_ds::face_shape(explorer.value());
    // ... use face
    explorer.next();
}
```

### Project a point onto a surface (compute distance)
```rust
use opencascade_sys::{b_rep, geom_api, extrema};
let surface = b_rep::Tool::surface_face(face);  // OwnedPtr<HandleGeomSurface>
let projector = geom_api::ProjectPointOnSurf::new_pnt_handlegeomsurface_extalgo(
    &point, &surface, extrema::ExtAlgo::Grad,
);
if projector.is_done() && projector.nb_points() > 0 {
    let dist = projector.lower_distance();
}
```

### Poly_Triangulation index convention
All node/triangle indices are **1-based** (OCCT convention).


### Bounded vs unbounded distance: BRepExtrema vs GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf
`GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` projects onto the *infinite* underlying `Geom_Surface`, not the bounded face. Use `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` (via `b_rep_extrema::DistShapeShape`) instead to compute distance to bounded `TopoDS_Face` shapes. Create a `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeVertex` from the point, then compute `DistShapeShape` between the vertex shape and the target shape. This correctly reports nonzero distance for points that lie on an infinite surface extension but outside the bounded face.

### Stage 2.1 planar hypothesis algorithm
- BFS region growing from seed faces using angular + vertex-distance tolerance.
- Angular threshold of `1e-6` (1 - cos ≈ 0.08°) prevents grouping faces with slightly different normals.
- Re-fitting via area-weighted normal averaging + vertex centroid for plane distance.
- For CAD meshes, vertices lie precisely on surfaces, so fit errors are typically 0 or near-epsilon.
- Coplanar but disconnected faces correctly get separate hypotheses (not a bug).
- The `vertex_tolerance_mm` config parameter controls the maximum vertex-to-plane distance for grouping.

### CodeCAD (ccad) test model generation
- `ccad build` in `tests/ccad/` generates both STL and STEP files from Lua scripts.
- `wedge(dx, dy, dz, ltx)` requires `ltx > 0` (cannot be 0).
- Boolean operations like `union()` work with pre-translated shapes.
- Parts are registered in `project.json`; each entry needs a unique `id`.
- Available primitives: `box()`, `cylinder(diameter, height)`, `sphere(diameter)`, `cone(d1, d2, height)`, `wedge()`, `hex_prism()`.
- Boolean operations: `union()`, `difference()`, `intersection()`.
- Transformations: `translate()`, `rotate_x/y/z()`, `scale()`, `center_xyz()` etc.
- Construction: `extrude(face, height)`, `revolve(profile, angle)`.
- Edge ops: `fillet_all(s, r)`, `chamfer_all(s, d)`.

### CAD tessellation quad-strip patterns
- Tessellated cylinders and spheres from CAD tools (CodeCAD/OCCT, Onshape) use quad-strip patterns where each quad facet splits into 2 coplanar triangles.
- Solution: stage 1.3 merges coplanar triangle pairs back into quads, so curved-surface facets become single faces with single-face planar hypotheses.
- This restores the clean "single-face = curved surface candidate" criterion for stages 2.2 and 2.3.
- Sphere poles are an exception: triangles in the polar fan pattern don't have coplanar neighbors and correctly remain as triangles.

### Stage 2.2 cylindrical hypothesis algorithm
- Two-step fitting: (1) axis direction from smallest eigenvector of area-weighted normal covariance matrix M = Σ wᵢ nᵢ nᵢᵀ, (2) axis position and radius via 2D algebraic circle fit after projecting vertices perpendicular to axis.
- 3×3 symmetric eigenvalue computation uses depressed cubic (trigonometric solution with cos(θ/3)), plus null-space eigenvector via cross products of (M - λI) rows.
- Multi-seed evaluation: for each starting face, collects ALL valid seed partners (not just the first), runs a trial BFS for each using temporary data (no mesh mutation during trials), keeps the best trial (most faces). Early termination abandons trials that rediscover the same cylinder as the current best.
- BFS seeds from pairs of adjacent faces with non-parallel normals (cross product > MIN_CROSS_THRESHOLD=0.01). Multi-face planar faces are excluded from seeding (both as seed face and seed partner) to prevent bogus large-radius cylinders from nearly-coplanar face pairs on curved surfaces. However, multi-face planar faces remain UNDEDUCED and CAN be absorbed by BFS expansion from nearby legitimate seeds.
- Angular coverage validation: after selecting the best trial, checks that face centroids span at least 3 angular clusters around the cylinder circumference. Computes angular coordinate θ for each face centroid, finds the largest gap (empty arc), and requires the second-largest gap ≤ span/3. Prevents bogus hypotheses from faces clustered on one side.
- Centroid validation after BFS: each face centroid must be within surface_tolerance of the fitted cylinder. This rejects spurious fits from perpendicular planar faces that algebraically fit a cylinder.
- Minimum 3-face requirement: cylinder hypotheses must contain at least 3 faces. Any real cylindrical surface from a CAD tessellation will have at least 3 facets around its circumference. This eliminates spurious 2-face cylinder fits from locally adjacent faces on tori, cones, and spheres (e.g., cone went from 29 to 0 spurious fits, pipe_elbow from 252 to 51).
- Angular tolerance check: both seed pairs and BFS expansion candidates must have dihedral angle ≤ `--angular-tolerance` (default 17.5°). This prevents fitting cylinders to faces that meet at sharp angles (e.g., cube faces at 90°). CAD tessellators enforce a maximum angular tolerance between adjacent triangles on the same surface.
- Extracting cylinder parameters from STEP: `b_rep_adaptor::Surface::cylinder()` → `gp::Cylinder`, then `.radius()`, `.axis().direction()`, `.axis().location()`. Useful for test verification.

### ccad box() coordinate system
- `box(w, h, d)` places the box in the positive octant: (0,0,0) to (w,h,d). It does NOT center at origin.
- To center a box, use `translate(box(w,h,d), -w/2, -h/2, -d/2)`.
- `cylinder(diameter, height)` is vertical (Z-axis), centered at the XY origin, extends from z=0 to z=height (NOT centered vertically). To make through-holes, translate cylinders vertically so they extend past both sides of the target body.
- `sphere(diameter)` is centered at the origin. To make hemispherical pockets or domes, use `intersection()` or `difference()` with a box.

### Stage 2.3 spherical hypothesis algorithm
- Algebraic least-squares sphere fitting: expand |v-c|²=r² linearly into 4 unknowns (cx, cy, cz, k=r²-|c|²). Normal equations AᵀAx = Aᵀb solved via 4×4 Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
- Current implementation: BFS seeds from pairs of adjacent faces with non-parallel normals. Planned change: vertex-neighborhood seeding (all faces incident on a mesh vertex), which naturally provides better angular diversity for the 4-DOF sphere fit.
- Multi-face planar faces excluded from seeding but absorb-able by BFS, same as cylindrical.
- Planned: solid-angle coverage validation (eigenvalue ratio test on centroid-to-center direction covariance matrix) to reject strip-like sphere hypotheses from cylinder fillet growth. Analogous to angular coverage for cylinders.
- With solid-angle coverage + surface-tolerance in BFS, max_sphere_radius can be relaxed from 10× to ~1000× bounding box diagonal — it only needs to prevent numerical precision issues, not algorithmic overgrowth.
- Centroid validation during BFS (not just post-BFS): each face centroid checked against surface_tolerance with 2x hard skip threshold.
- Minimum 4-face requirement: a sphere needs at least 4 non-coplanar points for a unique fit.
- All faces are candidates for BFS expansion (including those with cylindrical hypotheses and multi-face planar hypotheses). Only seeding excludes multi-face planar. Stage 2.6 resolves overlapping hypotheses.
- Torus faces locally fit spheres (e.g., pipe_elbow produces 36 sphere hypotheses). This is expected — stage 2.6 with torus hypothesis support will resolve it.
- Concave spheres (bowls/pockets) have normals pointing toward center — same convexity logic as cylinders.
- Angular tolerance check: same as cylindrical — seed faces and BFS neighbors must have dihedral angle ≤ `--angular-tolerance`. This fixed the spurious sphere detection on the 1mm manual cube.

### Stage 2.6 surface selection
- Greedy area-based selection: iteratively selects the hypothesis with the largest total remaining mesh face area, assigns its unassigned faces, removes those faces from all other candidates, repeats.
- Multi-face planar, cylindrical, and spherical hypotheses are candidates. Single-face planar hypotheses are fallback for unclaimed faces.
- After selection, hypothesis face/vertex lists are updated in-place to reflect only the faces actually assigned.
- Replaced the old per-face priority rule (spherical > cylindrical > multi-face planar > single-face planar) which failed when bogus small-area hypotheses of a high-priority type beat correct large-area hypotheses of a lower-priority type.
- Known issue: sphere BFS in stage 2.3 grows along cylinder fillet surfaces (locally, adjacent cylinder faces fit on a sphere), creating oversized sphere hypotheses. Greedy selection picks these over correct cylinders because they have more total area. Fix: solid-angle coverage validation in stage 2.3.
- Compare tolerance now uses `vertex_tolerance` for all hypothesis types (previously used `surface_tolerance` for planar).


### Stage 3.1 adjacency graph construction
- OCCT surface creation: `geom::Plane::new_pnt_dir`, `geom::CylindricalSurface::new_ax3_real`, `geom::SphericalSurface::new_ax3_real`. Type erasure via `.to_handle().to_handle_surface()` to get `OwnedPtr<HandleGeomSurface>`.
- Adjacency is determined from mesh edges: an edge between mesh faces assigned to different selected surfaces is a boundary edge.
- Boundary edges are grouped by `SurfacePair` (canonical ordering), then chained into ordered vertex sequences. Each chain becomes a `ReconEdge`.
- Corner vertices (where 3+ surfaces meet) become `BRepVertex` entries.
- Topological ordering of edges around each face uses rotation-order walk: at each vertex, pick the edge to the face that comes next in counter-clockwise order. For faces without vertices (closed loops like cylinder caps), all edges incident on that face are included.
- Bug encountered: closing vertex in topological walk was missing — after walking N edges around a face, the vertex connecting the last edge back to the first edge must be added separately.
- `wedge(10, 10, 10, 5)` in CodeCAD is a truncated wedge (8 vertices, 6 faces), NOT a triangular prism (6 vertices, 5 faces). The 4th parameter `ltx` is the top face X dimension.
- Euler formula V-E+F=2 is a good sanity check for genus-0 (no holes through the model) manifold solids. Models with through-holes have different Euler characteristics.
